class CrossEntropyFocalLoss(CrossEntropyLoss):
    r"""This criterion combines :func:`nn.LogSoftmax` and :func:`nn.NLLLoss` in one single class,
    and add focal Loss, as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002.
    It is essentially an enhancement to cross entropy loss and is
    useful for classification tasks when there is a large class imbalance.

    It is useful when training a classification problem with `C` classes.
    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D `Tensor`
    assigning weight to each of the classes.
    This is particularly useful when you have an unbalanced training set.

    The `input` is expected to contain raw, unnormalized scores for each class.

    `input` has to be a Tensor of size either :math:`(minibatch, C)` or
    :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)`
    with :math:`K \geq 1` for the `K`-dimensional case (described later).

    This criterion expects a class index in the range :math:`[0, C-1]` as the
    `target` for each value of a 1D tensor of size `minibatch`; if `ignore_index`
    is specified, this criterion also accepts this class index (this index may not
    necessarily be in the class range).

    The loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \text{loss}(x, class) = -\log\left(\frac{\exp(x[class])}{\sum_j \exp(x[j])}\right)
                       = -x[class] + \log\left(\sum_j \exp(x[j])\right)

    or in the case of the :attr:`weight` argument being specified:

    .. math::
        \text{loss}(x, class) = weight[class] \left(-x[class] + \log\left(\sum_j \exp(x[j])\right)\right)

    The losses are averaged across observations for each minibatch. If the
    :attr:`weight` argument is specified then this is a weighted average:

    .. math::
        \text{loss} = \frac{\sum^{N}_{i=1} loss(i, class[i])}{\sum^{N}_{i=1} weight[class[i]]}

    Can also be used for higher dimension inputs, such as 2D images, by providing
    an input of size :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`,
    where :math:`K` is the number of dimensions, and a target of appropriate shape
    (see below).


    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each class.
            If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C`
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When :attr:`size_average` is
            ``True``, the loss is averaged over non-ignored targets.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C)` where `C = number of classes`, or
          :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: :math:`(N)` where each value is :math:`0 \leq \text{targets}[i] \leq C-1`, or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of
          K-dimensional loss.
        - Output: scalar.
          If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then the same size as the target:
          :math:`(N)`, or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case
          of K-dimensional loss.

    Examples::

        >>> loss = CrossEntropyFocalLoss()
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.empty(3, dtype=torch.long).random_(5)
        >>> output = loss(input, target)
        >>> output.backward()
